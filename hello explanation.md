- **section .data**: This is where you define your initialized data. In this example, it contains the "Hello, World!" string.
- **section .text**: This is where the code is written. The `global _start` directive makes `_start` the entry point for the program.
- **_start**: This is the main label where the execution begins.
- **mov**: This instruction moves data from one place to another.
  - `mov eax, 4`: Sets up the `eax` register to indicate the `sys_write` syscall.
  - `mov ebx, 1`: Sets up the `ebx` register to indicate that the output should go to stdout.
  - `mov ecx, hello`: Points the `ecx` register to the string "Hello, World!".
  - `mov edx, hello_len`: Indicates the length of the string.
- **int 0x80**: This is the interrupt instruction that makes the system call.
- **xor ebx, ebx**: This zeroes out the `ebx` register, setting it to 0, which will be used as the exit code.
